* Update website front end with a date picker for historic leaderboards/stats
* Sankey Diagram for global stats
* Create a user page with per-user stats, graphs over time etc
* Show an icon for VIP users on the leaderboard
* Maybe an About or FAQ page explaining how the numbers are produced. It could be linked via like a "Not the numbers you were expecting?" link.
